<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Amazing Hanson, a student and web developer based in Turkey. With a passion for Coding and design, I am hoping with this I will achieve my goal of helping as many people solve and satisfy their tech problems as possible.

  I believe in the power of Hardwork and dedication, and I strive to be the best at what I bring to the table.</p>
  
  <p>My journey in Web development has equipped me with heightened problem solving skills, allowing me to brain storm and satisfy your needs.
  
  When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball/chess.
  
  Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about what I do.</p>
